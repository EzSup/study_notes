One of the earliest and most basic architectural forms is monolithic architecture. The system is intended to function as a single, self-contained unit in a monolithic application. Each component, including the data access layer, business logic, and user interface, is closely integrated into a single codebase.
## Characteristics:
- **Tight Coupling:** When parts are closely connected, it is challenging to scale or modify individual elements without influencing the system as a whole.
- **Simplicity:** Small to medium-sized applications might benefit from monolithic architectures since they are easy to build and implement.
- **Performance:** Monolithic programs can be quite performant because there are no inter-process communication overheads.
## Use cases:
Monolithic designs work well in smaller applications where performance and ease of use are more important than scalability and flexibility. Some e-commerce websites, blogging platforms, and content management systems (CMS) are a few examples.
